You must try their cookies. I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm. Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good. I mean, I was stuffed beyond belief, but I couldn't stop eating it! - If you get in during breakfast time, do try the Portuguese sausage. It's the only breakfast food really worth it.

I would have been okay with everything else if the food was outstanding. It really wasn't... I probably ate 3 bites of my dinner entree just to taste what the different Ingredients were... It was far from savory and could have used even a pasta or something. A couple of dry (what tasted like hush puppies)?? I would have been impressed a little if when I told the server that I didn't enjoy it if he would have offered to try one of the others, but I didn't make a big deal because like I said before he was really nice. The dessert was literally the only saving grace. All in all I gave a 2 star... (server and experience in the dark)... I just have to be honest incase others go in expecting a non-vegetarian meal... Be ready for a $200 vegetarian dinner!!!! *** also if they don't like your review on their Facebook page they will block you from commenting on other people talking crap about you, they can not handle the truth and allow others to put you down ***</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>6kEFHccntnYMF_7cdqCcKg</td><td>yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ</td><td>First off food is DELICIOUS! By far my favorite restaurant in downtown Phoenix. I have tried so many different things from the menu and it never disappoints, but the Saturday night special Prime Rib and Horseradish Dauphinoise Potato is my favorite. Second, the service is amazing. Ian is my favorite waiter, will request him every time! He is so personable with a good sense of humor!

We sat outside on the patio and watched the Food Channel and listened to music while going over the menu and having a great conversation with out out-of-country guests. The patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child. If you have a need for food with a great bite to it, this is the spot. We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp. Entree's were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork ribs, Caesar salad, bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton, which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels, fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top, which they did. If your stomach is sensitive, you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss. It's not that the food is spicy, it does the dance of the happy on your tongue and in your tummy. For some people, it may be too much but for me, this is a good thing!</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>8fpiTkK4MO5jJIXHFV4t5Q</td><td>5n2dA_QqO4c_7pSK0Of6AQ</td><td>I was told so many great things about this place but my entire experience was awful.

I can't believe I paid $14 for a small meal with no extra fixings. On national cheeseburger day of all days too. Such a disappointment and I've never gone back since.

My favorites are the Chicken Scarpariello, the pizza and the Sangria. My wife can't decide between four dishes. Our daughter loves the Penne ala Vodka, Lasagna, or Ravioli. Mario and his sons work hard to please and we've never had a bad meal here. I've seen them bend over backwards to try and take care of obvious jerks. Plus to top it off, when local school invited local pizza places to present to a class on making pizza and recycling issues, Mario came and talked to the kids as if they were adults. All the other places treated it as a marketing event and brought coupons. Get the idea?

However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices. First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was. I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>pHKISjytTmP0LrP952_32w</td><td>xS5HGqgk0KY2jFWU-l_nrA</td><td>I'm not that familiar with Scottsdale so I'm just guessing that this restaurant is fairly new.

I also enjoyed whatever the dressing was, I just wish it would have been on the side. For whatever reason it was poured on and also came with a cup of it on the side. We agreed that the prices seemed a bit high for the experience. It has a similar feel to Bravo but service just isn't at that level yet (from our experience). Our sever did not know anything about the menu or what is fried in their fryers which should be expected at $18+ a plate. (We asked because of food allergies) She did however make sure to note allergies on our order which we appreciated! The music also did not match the setting.

She decided on getting the pork belly ramen and two sushi rolls. The ramen was good, a little salty, but I'd recommend it. Then we received the Spider roll, which was great. Next up was the Crispy roll, which was where the problems arose. We had to wait over 45 minutes for one roll. After about half an hour they finally brought us a different roll to apologize for it taking so long. Apparently they didn't have the crispy rice prepped so that was what was taking so long. I myself am a server, and although the server came over and apologized several times, it probably would have been a good idea to have the manager come and apologize. We finally got it and it was okay, and they ended up comping it, which was nice.

I've taken this to go as well as eaten inside the market, and I can say that the pizza doesn't do well reheated. So try to eat it fresh while there if possible. If one of their specialty pizzas sounds good to you, go for it, as those are definitely a better deal for the amount of toppings you get for the money. I wanted what I wanted, though, so I ended up with a medium, thin crust, regular crust pizza with jalapenos, pepperoncini, onions and feta. It was pretty expensive at $2\\/topping = $20 med pizza. But it was delicious. The arugula salad with goat cheese and lemon vinaigrette is to-die-for. I crave that dressing days later.

However, Chica completely nailed it. The whole chicken with chimichurri is a must-have (we shared it among four people) and the small dishes were delicious as well.

However, for the high price of everything (not just the steaks) on the menu, we would've expected the place to feel more exclusive, more fancy, not so loud. It felt like a nice bar rather than a fine dining establishment. We had to shout over the noise and the place wasn't even totally full (Sunday evening). The plates were also nothing special to look at. Again because of the price, we expected a few frills. The meat and separate sides came out just plainly put onto plates. No effort was put into the presentation. Even casual restaurants throw some greens or garnishes on the dish for a little extra aesthetic. Probably won't return.

I told her I was visiting MC in January and she encouraged me to try some enchiladas down there to prove the similarities. The enchiladas I had were unlike any I've ever had. Perhaps this is how they are supposed to be? The chicken was not wrapped in a tortilla. The two tortillas were sautéed in green chiles, folded over and laid at the bottom of the dish. It was then topped with lettuce, chicken, crema and all the other good stuff. It was the best I've ever had. I mean it. Warning: When the dish indicates it's spicy, it's spicy. Those were the spiciest enchiladas I've ever had, but I appreciate the spice. My gf, however, was fortunate in her decision to get the carnitas because she would have not been able to handle the enchiladas. By the way, the carnitas were excellent, as well.

They make them with their back to you and you can not see the items they put on and they don't even ask what you want on it. They just proceed to make it the way they want. I can honestly say you get so much more for your money at Subway for much less and you can make the sub the way you want and you get very full and sometimes even have leftovers! The soup was hot and had a good flavor but such a small container and they fill just above half. We didn't get much at all. Over all not our favorite sub place. Not happy. Not sure if we would go back here.</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>SNpi9tKh2EUWdbxAELLMpA</td><td>9t8PEynZGVCG1EjOQr1xBA</td><td>\"Seeing \"\"Chicago\"\" in the name of a taco shop gave me a little pause</td><td> but the food and employees are both 5 stars.

We used the Yelp check in offer for a free entree with the purchase of a drink which is an awesome way to try something new. It was also ocean day insulated bag day which is really nice and will be used when grocery shopping this summer or transporting hot food to keep it warm. We had a chimicurri steak burrito with chips as well as a cabo platter which is a burrito and taco. The steak burrito was really good because of the chimicurri sauce which had a refreshing and light taste. The shrimp burrito that came with the platter wasn't as good as it was heavier on the rice and beans so it didn't feel like it had enough shrimp but the taco made up for it. The drinks they have are different and refreshing too, I had a pomegranate lemonade by odowalla that uses real sugar instead of corn sryup. I really recommend going to Rubios for a lighter refreshing meal, try the fish tacos and sign up for their club for emails on special offers.</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>S6boRo4sQ1onCOpxhWkobw</td><td>KGqvUQQA4c9GJpi5-znsew</td><td>So I've been coming here for years and have never had any issues until today. I ordered what I've always ordered. A bean burrito, a taco and a drink. It cost over $9 dollars!! The lady didn't tell me a price in the drive through which is annoying because they don't have a screen that tells you. She asked if I wanted a bean and cheese burrito. Well obviously I said yes I want cheese in it. The price on the menu said it was like $2.50. There was no mention of cheese in my burrito costing more. So I pull up to the window and she tells me it will be $9.40 or whatever. I said, I'm sorry how much?? So I'm sitting there doing my own math and it still didn't add up. $2.09 for a drink, $2 something for the taco and $2 something for the burrito. Even with tax there was absolutely no way that it would have added up to that much. So I get the receipt and they charged me $4.58 for a burrito!! There sign said $2 something. I pulled around and went in and their price inside said $3 something for the burrito. I went up and asked why I was overcharged $4.58 for a burrito. He said because I got cheese in it. I said, your burritos don't come with cheese in them??? They always have and I've never been charged extra for it!! What place doesn't put cheese in a burrito?? Also, for the first time their taco was bad. I opened the box and the taco shell was wet and soggy!! Usually it's nice and crispy\\/crunchy and this time was not. I told them their signs are wrong. Also that it's ridiculous you charge that much for a burrito with cheese!! Told them I will never be back!! I can get better food at Taco Bell and more food for the same price!!

We got seated fairly quickly. Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it. Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid. After that it went downhill from there. We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai. We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters. My family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing. We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table! after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters. We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry. So it was fine for now. After we got the water nothing else came to us. We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served. After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out. First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three. Finally the drinks came out as well. I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour. For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho. Oh man was I wrong. The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat. The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder. My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth. The bowl was mostly disappointing broth. There were very little meat and noodles. We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible. We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home. It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup. In the end it was just terrible. My family and I went home unhappy. And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important. Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse. If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers. The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything. I am never going back. I really hope they clean up their act, there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don't fix things it will be buried beneath the rest.</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>7Gl4ah_uRVmXPro_J2PFRg</td><td>nZAJ2a2-Oyxt6GzX97i2pg</td><td>Great wings , and the breakfast is pretty good also .the Cook does a great job on the food .

There were these two grouchy ladies dealing with us at the entrance and we have to wait ridiculously long for a table even though the restaurant is almost empty. Then we have to sit as far away from the food as possible. When we ask to sit closer they say no. We ask why and they say no one is covering that area. Seems like they could easily fix that or make one exception, I mean its a buffet. we won't be needing much service if any. Luckily that lady who took our drink orders was pretty nice and came over often to clear our plates and refill our mimosas. The food at the buffet was one of the better buffets I've had in Vegas, definitely better than Monte Carlo's or Harrah's, but nothing compared to Paris or Mirage. I was told Caesar's Palace is the best, but I've never had it. From the looks of it, I'm sure its a million times better than this place. If you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's. We got a great deal from tix4tonight. Definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in Vegas. One really cool feature here is the salad bar, where they make you a salad fresh for you. I really enjoyed the Chinese Chicken Salad. There's also a dessert area that has more choices than a lot of the other buffets, though the execution of them aren't so great. Definitely worth going to for the food, but I really thought the service was the worst out of all the restaurants I went to in Vegas. For those reasons I probably won't go back, but I wouldn't tell people not to go.</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>MXwWj1pbG29aC3tFdyo7XA</td><td>R1jJQi2yR44D_2ileqr8kA</td><td>My companion and I went to Living Kitchen on an impulse and am very happy to say it was delicious and worth it!

Poor choice in closing the extra room after all these years. The service for the food depends on the day and if Glendale is hosting a event.

My teammate is a huge fan and suggested this place to the rest of the team for a big team dinner Saturday night. It's located right next to the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, so we were able to walk over. The restaurant is pretty big itself, but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly, local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us), we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal, since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends, but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though, plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad, garlic bread, pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread, but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too! More of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest. Service was good. They were kind enough to split our party in two, to help make the check easier.

What I ended up with was penne with canned tomato sauce and what I swear was frozen meatballs. At $12...what a shame.

He didn't even bother to tell me what time the order would be ready. I frequent this place for lunch and use them for work events pretty frequently and have always had a decent experience but not this time. When I got home and went to unpack the food, I realized the order was completely wrong. Checked the receipt and the order that was rung in was completely different then what I asked for and with totally different quantities. It was as if the order was erased and the guy just tried to make it up out of memory. Certainly was not please to have ordered mainly calzones and end up with almost all subs. The most annoying part of the experience is the sausage, pepper and onion subs were 85% peppers and onions. There was about 10 slices of very very thin sausage on the entire sandwhich which I think is a ripoff for $8.99. Terrible experience overall and will highly make me reconsider ever going here again.</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>RpCCOplY7bv-qF0NO42CAw</td><td>FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ</td><td>Authentic and Rustic full of ambiance..

Now I remember, we had an AMAZING desert. A sopapilla topped with ice cream and strawberries. It was DELISH!! We met Juan the owner who welcomed us and our little toddler. Juan said he built the place to accomodate families and that their daily Happy Hours are restaurant-wide - and not exclusive to the bar only like many places in town. Their daily happy hour from 3-7pm looked really good! Our server was very friendly and the service was great! The Mariachi band was an added bonus - we would love to return to hear them again.

The pie emerged from the wood fire oven piping hot, with a slightly burnt crust. It lasted approximately 5 minutes before vanishing into our hungry bellies.

Went with my daughter and two of her friends- and I totally loved this place! I liked the high ceilings, the cozy decor, the lighting, and the marketplace feel of the interior... Because of numerous raves on yelp, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. It's true, they are totally fabulous- not to be missed! I had chicken scaloppini, which was delicious- perfectly prepared, and served with just the right amount of sauce and Mediterranean olives. The girls all ordered pasta dishes- raved about, and then subsequently demolished them. There wasn't one crumb of food left on anyone's plate! The focaccia bread with pesto is wonderful, and they have a great wine list here. I had a glass of Syrah from Washington state, which was thankfully served at the right temperature and was very nicely balanced.

Drink orders were placed, and when our margaritas arrived, they were really, really off and tasted terrible. Even after stirring, and thinking positive thoughts- they just were off- not sweet enough, and didn't taste good. Our server was cool and he swapped them out for other stuff. My replacement drink was a Polish Fizz, and it was perfect. Highly recommended. For an app we went with the pretzel fondue, thanks to Yelpers who recommended it. As advertised, it was delicious, and I recommend it. For lunch I had the fish and chips, and my friend had some salad. The fish and chips were very tasty, but the price point, for the portion I got- just didn't compute. Three pieces of fish (think chicken tender size) and a small portion of fries, along with a small side of overly vinegared cole slaw. Again, the food was good, but you definitely don't get what you pay for. I understand the concept of smaller portions, euro style, etc. but for a bar food staple? I wasn't looking for a Costco serving of anything, but either bump up portion size, or drop the price from $16 to $11.50. I really liked our server, but for some reason as things went on, he was more and more absent. To be fair, we had a really difficult person that joined us, some of the stuff this person said made me want to pull my hair out, so I feel his pain. Anyway, AB is a very attractive spot that might be great for drinks and app. but for this price point, I would hit Durant's, Hillstone, or Beckett's Table.

Alexander's pizza also serves Italian and Greek entree meals. The pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world!

Beyond the (yes, I do realize it was intentional) misspelling of the name of the restaurant, Lucki Thai doesn't miss on many marks for me. I've had the opportuniti to dine in, get carri out, and order deliveri (I'll stop this now) from Lucki on many occasions in the last few months, so I can tell you that no matter which method you decide to go with for your thai food fix there you won't be disappointed. The first time I had Lucki I dined in and had the Tom Yum soup with Shrimp and their Crab Fried rice. The Tom Yum Soup is consistently good, and I'd know since it's been a staple of every single order I've made with Lucki since. It's always hot, with the perfect combination of sour and spicy, and loaded with mushrooms and an ample amount of shrimp. The large order feeds 2 perfectly. The crab fried rice is not something I tend to order, but Lucki's version definitely packed a lot of crab flavor. They also weren't shy with the egg on the rice, and being an egg slut like Anthony Bourdain, that pleased me. I've done a mix of delivery and take-out many times since, and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before), and the food has almost always been ready to go when I arrive for a carry-out order. Of the items I've ordered those times, the curries have been phenomenal, as has the spicy eggplant entree. I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that I've had similar dishes, but I usually gobble it up so fast there's no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it's absolutely delectable. I'm also a huge fan of their brown rice option, even though it's $2 extra. Lucki's brown rice is one of the only in the city that I feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it. I'm pretty sure it's not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice. I also really liked the Rad Na, though my laziness knows no bounds in that I felt like it was a lot of work eating it. It's truly shameful. The only order I wasn't completely thrilled with so far was the Beef Pad See Ewe. The flavors were nice, but the beef was tough and chewy. A simple misstep which I can forgive. I have to admit I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with Lucki Thai thus far: spice consistency. I started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go-to at other Thai joints, but didn't find them spicy enough. I've now settled on an 8, which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow. Getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8, it had literally ZERO spice. It actually might have gotten into the negatives. It's quite frustrating because I suspect if I move into the 9-10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan. WHAT'S MY NEXT MOVE HERE? But alas, the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci.

Their Latin Street food was fresh and very, very tasty. The Empanadas were perfectly cooked and juicy, not dry at all. The street corn, which is a favorite of mine, was the best I have had so far. I can highly recommend their shrimp and steak tacos which were soft and had great flavor. We ordered sliced avocado, creamy cold quacamole and together with the rosa sauce and fresh lime on the side made for a meal levels above what we paid for or expected. I love that you have so many choices to choose from to make up a meal that will satisfy any food cravings or preferences you might have and it is fresh and clean. On top of this the staff is friendly and very helpful. Such a joy!

Definitely add the black garlic oil, it's a must! Everything here is prepared fresh and from scratch. It's definitely worth coming back to. Customer service is excellent and we truly loved our experience. The chefs are super helpful and they really care about their customers. It's a simple place with a small menu but their ramen is delicious. The noodles are freshly made as well as their pork. The soft boiled egg is perfectly made and isn't overly seasoned. I would recommend coming here.</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>5gGMfEiTpZaAGlpRcvCM4w</td><td>IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng</td><td>\"OK, my first yelp review, so bear with me. I tend to break things down into categories, so I'll go with that for now. Atmosphere: Confusing. Decor is kinda kitschy, supposedly to evoke dinner at mom's or something of that order. Yeah, if you have really loud obnoxious relatives; maybe it's due to the construction of the space, but the place was LOUD! For the price (more about that later), this is a special-occasion restaurant for most of us, but I wouldn't recommend it for an romantic\\/intimate one. Service: No complaints here. Our server (Eric, I believe) was extremely pleasant and most helpful. He took the time to explain some of the menu items, checked on us fairly often, and was generally very friendly. High marks here. Food (quality): Again, very few complaints. Food was fresh and flavorful; portions, while not huge, were pretty satisfying. My wife had the roasted beet salad (actually part of the 4-course special but our server told us we could order it a la carte) and enjoyed it very much. I started with the Caesar...the black garlic dressing was delicious! Highly recommended! My wife's filet mignon was well prepared and presented; I had the brick oven chicken and was very pleased. Moist, tasty, and the mac & cheese was excellent. Topped off with the Brookie for dessert, a very nice meal. Food (value): And here's why I tend to shun trendy restaurants. A cocktail, a glass of wine, a beer, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert: just this side of $140. Brief breakdown: the beer, although a John Smith from England, was served out of a can! Some may call this \"\"ironic\"\"; I say</td><td> \"\"tacky!\"\" The aforementioned beet salad?

My wife just finished running a marathon and was extremely cold. Seeing her shiver, our waiter brought her a cup of homemade chicken vegetable soup on the house. Who does that these days? The service really was great. From start to finish. The food was excellent. It was standard fare for a grill but you can tell those that prepared it really cared. I had the LA wrap and my wife had more soup. Both were really good. They make fresh, homemade soup every day. I'll be back.

First off, so you don't think I'm some elitist bastard, let me state that I happily eat food at IHOP and Denny's. Anyway, so as I was with a bunch of college friends last weekend in Vegas, apparently eating at The Peppermill was a MUST?!? The decor of the place with it's bright neon rainbow purplish lights was a felt like a cross between Denny's and a Strip Club..I don't really dig that kind've ambience unless i'm actually in a strip club... Service was okay nothing really stood out as good or bad, and prices are actually good for being on the strip and having burgers around $9-10 and steaks are like $25 (although i'd rather spend $5-10 more and go to a legit steakhouse). So why 2 stars? well..the food absolutely sucked. I ordered a Swiss mushroom burger w\\/curly fries. First off, the burger and curly fries LOOKED delicious..but upon eating my food..I found absolutely no taste in any of the food, even after adding tons of salt and pepper to it. It's as if some mixture of oil and plastic got in my food that negated anything that could add taste to my food. Plus the mayo I got came in this bowl and let's say something about it's color and texture didn't look right. Anyway, the service and price were okay, decor a little dirty feeling for my taste. But what really killed it was that the food lacked any taste at all. Save your money and go to In & Out Burger at the other end of the strip, or even Burger King much closer at O'Sheas. ~G</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>kdDTqKBbfNZeKEbWAcqZWQ</td><td>_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA</td><td>Located at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas.

Guess they were to busy to care about the quality of their food. I ordered my regular Asiago ranch spicy chicken sandwich. Got my food at the window I always do a quality check no matter what, looked at my sandwich and it had honey mustard on it, last time I checked honey mustard and ranch were two different things. So I sent it back, the girl who made it came to the window and argued that it was made correctly. I said no, because Asiago ranch isn't yellow and doesn't taste like honey mustard. She said I know I made it right I said ok, well I don't want it. So she took it back brought me another one this time a regular chicken sandwich with a ranch packet. Yeah I paid 7 dollars for a ranch packet with a chicken sandwich. Sweet girl right, nasty attitude to boot. So I took it into the store this time, and the manager showed me the ranch in the bottle that was suppose to be on my sandwich and remade it. Wow imagine that someone who new how to make it without attitude. I'm still very disappointed money is money no matter where you spend it at. And I expect to get what I ask for with my money.

I've only tried one entree from the menu, but if the other choices are anything like what I ate today I will definitely be a regular here. I tried the Pad Kee Mao with chicken. If you don't know what this is, it consists of rice noodles, onion, Thai basil, chili, a little bell pepper and a slice of tomato in there somewhere - all covered in spicy brown sauce. The flavor of this entree was amazing - definitely something I will order again. One of my co-workers decided to eat light and ordered the chicken satay, which he also enjoyed. Service here was great - Brian took good care of us. They seem to be doing well since they opened. Decent crowd at lunch, but not too packed.

Now I live in the Arcadia area so this is the one we frequent. I haven't noticed a huge difference between the two locations, same great food, same stoned servers. My usual is the Portabello burger. The balsamic marinade they use is fantastic. The presentation is a little messy, but once it hits your lips it's so good. I pass on the new potatoes for steamed spinach and it's pretty amazing. Everyone knows the hummus rocks. I love how they let you split up a small order between the roasted bell pepper and jalapeno cilantro. It's like a little hummus sampler for less than $5. The service can be spotty, especially when it comes to drink refills, but I've surprisingly never had an order come out incorrectly. I normally would not be surprised by this standard service expectation being consistently fulfilled, but I have had some BAKED servers here, so the fact that they can remember my steamed spinach substitution each and every time is kind of impressive.

I already wasn't really thrilled about coming to this joint. I checked the reviews, they weren't really poppin. I looked at pics, weren't enough of them. And the menu looked... okay. But I'm always down for something new and different and my homie was eager to check this place out, so why not? Welp, it wasn't good my friend. I ordered the Packhouse burger; because, if you can't do a burger right, then something is seriously wrong. And it was ALL wrong. Not once but twice. My other homie decides to get the same thing. She didn't want the tomato jam (she's allergic to tomatoes) and she wanted hers cooked medium well. I wanted the tomato jam and my meat to be cooked medium. You following so far? We both asked for the Mac and cheese as a side. Side note: why do they not have fries???!!! Not even sweet potato fries???!! Like forreal tho. Anyway, they bring out my homies burger and my other friends dish. They bring out my food last. There's a TON of mustard on my burger. Literally all I can taste is mustard. They killed my meat. Like if the cow wasn't dead before they cooked it, they made sure they killed it when they grilled it. And after a few bites I noticed I didn't have any tomato jam. Come to find out they switched me and my homies Burgers. Although her meat was well done and dry as well. My homie is breaking out (tomato allergy) and I'm just over the burger. They were nice enough to comp our burgers and asked if we wanted new ones. We were good with that. They also said they would give us free dessert. OKAAAAY!!! New Burgers come out, they get the toppings right and the chef wasn't as enthusiastic with the mustard the second go round. HOWEVER! My meat was still dry and over cooked. {sigh}.... whatever. I couldn't finish the burger. Like the meat was a choking hazard. The Mac and cheese was aight. I love Gouda, but it wasn't hittin it. Ah well. My other homie said her crab cake was too juicy. I didn't get much else from her meal but she did say this place was 2 star worthy as well. Also we get the complimentary bread and butter AFTER we get our food. The homie has to ask for the bread and butter. Strange and not needed at that point. The desserts (forgot to take pics) were actually really good. The hummingbird cake was moist and not too sweet. I don't like nuts but I had several bites anyway cause the flavor was really good. The oatmeal cream pie cookie joint was pretty good but again I'm not a fan of nuts and thick creamy icing. But anyone who is down for this, would love it! So there you have it. The service was top notch. I gave more than 20% of what my bill would have been because I can't fault the staff, but I'm sorry guys, the food needs some work. The location and setup is dope. The vibe is chill and everyone is really attentive and nice.

But after putting up with crappy service just to get the Sourdough burger I love, the argument with a man who was either the GM or the owner about whether a service dog could come in his bar was the last straw. I'm not sure why he thinks he can refuse service to someone coming in with a service dog, but that was the last straw for me.

But our favorite part of the meal was the side of truffle fries - wow! Thought it was great that they had local beer options from McFate Brewing on tap - rare to find them on tap around the valley outside of the brewery. Our server was very pleasant and helpful, and my wife got a birthday card from the staff since it was her birthday. We returned for breakfast the next day. Breakfast menu was considerably smaller and a lot less options, but the food was really good. I had the ham & cheese omelette, which was great.

Except for the BIG Bloody Mary meal - slim jim, pickles, cheese cubes, peppers, candied bacon !!!!; sausage; red onion (see pics, only large U6 shrimp were missing. ..) everything else was a disappointment. Service was very strange - the smiles were abundant, but everything else about the service was off, from how scarce our server was, to her not willing to take an order for breakfast from us, yet a table seated after us served by someone else got breakfast; to how long it took to place our orders, to how long it took to get our order. I got the wings - terrible, even though they are a signature dish. Bland, small, bones broken with sharp points and bone chips all throughout...now that I think about it, I don't know why I didn't complain and send it back. Maybe I was too consumed consuming the bowl sized meal of a Bloody Mary.

I've been very happy on my recent visits to BRFC. Our chicken combos were tender, juicy, crispy, and flavorful. We like to order their chicken tender combos and dip them in all their different sauces. My husband and I really enjoy it and plan on returning. Pros: * Friendly & efficient service when you order at the counter * Clean and modern decor with plenty of seating\\/table options and large windows * Large TVs (we watched football during one of our visits) * Combos include their shoestring fries and small cup of coleslaw Fries: skinny, crispy, salty, and plentiful | Coleslaw: a bit bland for my taste * Their juicy chicken has a nice crisp crunch with a tasty and flavorful seasoning. Their chicken is delicious with a slight spicy dry coating (a hint of cajun) We do not find it to be greasy and the breading was light and not overwhelming * Their Boylan pop is served at a soda fountain and is sweetened with cane sugar and refillable * Their iced tea is sweetened with honey or unsweetened and refillable * Milkshakes are thick and creamy and my husband always orders one with his chicken * Honey Dipping Sauce options: wildflower, chipotle and wasabi honey flavors I LOVE all their honey options for my chicken tenders * Other Dipping Sauce options: habanero hot sauce and their own BRBBQ barbecue dip * Lunch Box Special Deal: M-F | 11am - 4pm | 3 whole wings, fries, and a drink = 8 bucks Cons: * It seems a bit pricey for what it is. Essentially, it is priced a little higher than what you would expect for a chicken joint. You're looking at $10 - $15 a person for combos. However, I do find it to be a higher quality than most chicken joints. It's an upscale atmosphere for a 'fast casual' restaurant.

They tried three times to achieve medium rare but just couldn't get it right. Fortunately, for me our waitress who was fabulous was more upset about it than I was. She would take it back to the kitchen even before I had the opportunity to complain. The manager stopped by and was so apologetic and gave us a gift card to come back.

That's okay, so I ordered a bowl of soup to take home... it was 11.00, and that okay too. My only thing is that it looked like a cup and the soup was not too fresh. It was good though. I'm not too sure if I would go back because the prices seemed too high and for a bowl of soup being 11.00, it wasn't great and there was much, but broth.</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>jqQrL1GQJGKiWH4im6aZGg</td><td>fgA9aoU0gNK80hhXhiUpSQ</td><td>We had breakfast there today for about $25 each with tax and fees included but 2 of our party of 4 were covered by the bed and breakfast deal from JW Marriott and they didn't charge for the kid.

The convenience store and bakery\\/coffeeshop is located at the entrance to the casino and near the elevators to the rooms which is a plus if you need to get a quick pick-me-up or forgot to pack something.

I don't have any pictures to post because we ate everything too fast! We used the check-for free coffee and tea to start while we munched on the complementary granola, which was a nice roasted salty and sweet flavor. Then our savory crepes came out quickly, the breakfast burrito for him and a custom buckwheat for me (white cheddar since they were out of Gouda, with local ham). Mine came with a side of dressed greens that complemented the crepe well. I was disappointed I could only order scrambled eggs on the side when I wanted a gooey poached egg because they had already cracked all the eggs, so I skipped the eggs. As we finished up our main course our sweet crepe came out. I was surprised how full I was from the one savory crepe, but I made room for my half of a simple bruleed crepe with nuts. You can really taste the quality of the crepe itself when it's minimally dressed. We finished with the complementary dessert of chocolate triangles and a rose infused marshmallow roasted right at the table. Overall I'm very happy with our experience and the friendly service.

I'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had NO clue how HUGE this place was!!! We sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) The ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! There were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment. But enough of that, on to the main event. We had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested, omakase style :) - Cucumber cocktail on the house!!! They brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! Very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :) - A trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame, roasted shito peppers, and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but I think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick) - Yellowtail Sashimi MINI TACOS!!! These were sooo fun and delicious! Great fushion idea! The restaurant is VERY accommodating, we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! The flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy. But I think I still enjoy DOS CAMINO'S mini tacos better...those are to.die.for. - Ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf. This was an interesting combination. Probably my least favorite dish of the night. The basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much. - Filet Mignon with oversized asparagus. The meat was tender and very well cooked, very pink in the middle. I'm not a big beef eater so I only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it. Definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy. The ASPARAGUS however, was QUITE delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) A good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside! - Sea Bass with oversized Peruvian corn!!! YUMMMY!!!! The sea bass was nice and flaky. Flavoring was a bit salty but I feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want LOL The peruvian corn was just really fun to eat!! My friends really enjoyed it but I definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :) - MUSHROOM POT ON CRACK. THIS WAS DEFINITELY THE SHOW STOPPER OF THE NIGHT!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. The sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. We all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!! - 4 different Sushi Rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars). All 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfortunately. :( I'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so I can't pretend these were anything to die for. ***The first time I came my friend ordered for the table and I definitely think that made a difference. They have some REALLY scrumptious dishes that I wish I could've ordered for my friends to try!! Perhaps next time!! I'll be more prepared lol OVERALL RATINGS: Food - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that) Food (for the first time I came) - 4.25 stars! Drink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of Santa Margaritta Pino Grigio Presentation - 4 stars Service & Ambiance - 4 stars I gave this place 4 stars mainly because I had a great time that night, and the company I kept definitely played a big part in that.

However what is putting them from a solid 3 to a 4 is the value and service. Seriously, a chopped or caesar salad for 3.95? 5-7pm Happy Hour that includes half off starters, pizzas, and glasses of wine, wow, for real! So with that being said we had a great time at Marcella's, yes folks a chain, but a decent chain with only a few locations in Ohio. The straight forward menu makes for easy navigation and the helpful suggestive service was more than enough to make decisions easy. Okay, we kinda freaked out when we heard the half off starts and pizzas.. we ordered way to much but was so worth it. Started with the meaty Sicilian pizza, topped with Capacola, Salami, Meatballs, Asiago Cheese, Red Onion, which was probably my favorite. The crust was thin and crunchy and all of the flavors of the meats and cheese really were balanced so I could taste each with one bite after the next. Beef Carpaccio was a close runner up with its thinly shaved rare beef, toasted capers and wild arugula. The flavors were bright thanks in part to the lemon aioli. The Braised Veal Meatball was so light and tender I wanted to order another as my entree rather than the Gnocchi con Bolognese . The problem with the gnocchi was the gnocchi themselves. Kind of like eating raw biscuit dough, but the lamb bolognese was simple and delicious. The Chicken Parmesan was served how I like to eat with both alfredo & tomato sauce. My only wish is that it had just a bit more sauce so I could use the house ciabatta to sop up the extra. Desserts are kept simple like the rest of the menu so we shared with Cherry Crustada. The crust was light and flaky, the cherries filling slightly tart and the ice cream rich and creamy, *pant pant* yum! This was certainly a pleasant experience with a welcoming laid back feel, generous portions and affordable pricing. Oh yes, they also use Opentable.com for free online reservations, so yes, I'm definitely a fan!!!</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>W1Xd65mNdJSVpVi8Z3-KHg</td><td>rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw</td><td>My daughter and her boyfriend were very excited to go here.

She gave us the low down of her spot answering any questions about the food we had. Now onto the meat and potatoes, literally! Three of us got a large loaded potato, each topped with different meats. One had the beef brisket, the other had pulled pork, and I got the buffalo chicken. Don't expect your food to come out in a minute like it was just microwaved. Everything was freshly put together and it was beyond worth it! Each meat was cooked to perfection with amazing flavors throughout the potato.

That space in Downtown Chandler has a new tenant, and they seem like a keeper. DC Steak House is a rarity in Phoenix; a mid-priced, independent steak houses in a sea of chain restaurants and a la carte wallet busters. Looks: Well, it does look fairly similar to the previous restaurants, except they changed the bar area and the art. I like it. It's elegant and not too dark or too partitioned. There's a mural on one wall that I think the owner painted. The place is a nice addition to Downtown, which is still fighting off the urban sprawl of mega-chains. Crowd: Seemed happening, although it was Opening Night. A wide mix of young and old. Food: My eye was drawn to the large selection of fish, but I decided to go with steak at a steak house. The salad was solid. I especially liked the Italian dressing with a little Feta cheese in it. Bread was OK. My steak was great, tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Served with a (undercooked) baked potato, and sauteed mushrooms. My friend ordered the walleye. I was a big fan, but he said it was a little bland compared to what he catches in Minnesota. Maybe that was a fish story. Value: Here's where I thought this place shined. Meals were in the $18-30 range, including salad and potato. They have $10 sandwiches, too, but they're not served on Fri\\/Sat until after 9pm. Seems fair. Service: Service was slow, although it was Opening Night. They also screwed up my friend's appetizer, serving him the wrong kind of wing sauce. However, the people could not have been nicer. The owner apologized and bought us desserts. (Chocolate Decadence Cake was delicious, although a little rich for my taste.) Then, the chef came out , shook our hands, and bought us drinks. I felt like I was in a place where people would remember my name, even though they surely won't. Miscellaneous: A lot of decisions haven't been made yet. Will they serve lunch? What will they do for happy hour? (a crucial decision in my mind.) Even the menu will likely vary in the coming months.

It felt like a completely different restaurant. First off--cash only. Wasn't ready for that. Luckily, they have an ATM onsite. Secondly, they really nerfed the size of the Dutch Baby here. I worked up my friends at how awesome and overwhelmingly large the Dutch Baby is (and that you could share it with two people), but it was a disappointment. It was bit dry, almost burnt and stale tasting. Third, I felt very rushed. I know that there is a long line, but they were really pushy about cleaning up our plates immediately after we finished and it made for an uncomfortable eating experience. All in all, there is little to distinguish this place from an IHOP.</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>2Yq-5WcGtgN1en47vJ1z2g</td><td>tLSgXuy0g8nxX6Xgb7nvrw</td><td>Greasy unappetizing fried food.

We walked in around 6:30pm on a Friday night, the restaurant was about half filled. There were plenty of seats in the the front of the restaurant but our party of four was seated in the very back beside the bathrooms and back door. We sat there for a few minutes (not wanting to be difficult or affecting the order in which the servers were sat) but we really couldn't take the cold draft from the back patio door and constant bathroom visits. We politely ask if we could move to the front. The hostess obliged but didn't seem too happy about it. The same server continued to wait on us once we sat in the front (we were glad because we did not want to make him lose a table) . We were brought a loaf of soft bread to table, pretty tasty but the butter is a little different. It is a sweet butter with orange zest. We were told they were out of the ricotta ravioli (the dish I happened to be eyeing) but was told they can substitute the mushroom ravioli. I ordered the mushroom ravioli, my husband the lasagna, our friends ordered the chicken pot pie (all white meat), and chicken Marsala with ravioli side. The server came back out and told us there was only enough ravioli for one of us...... so my friend changed his order to the green beans and mashed potato side. When our meals came out they served him ravioli, he was told by the server they found some ravioli in the back- um okay, would have been nice to know before he got his meal as he was already looking forward to eating the dish he thought he ordered. He was served a 2 mushroom ravioli and 1 ricotta (which he said was much better than the mushroom). I was told by my friends that the chicken Marsala and chicken pot pie were good. My husband's lasagna was good but very rich!! I could only eat a couple bits, he couldn't finish it. My mushroom ravioli was bland and tasteless. The cream sauce was very watery. I did not enjoy my main dish at all. On the bright side though, we all got salads and really enjoyed them. I had the small blue wedge salad. It was a large portion with fresh cooked crispy bacon on top. Really good! Our server disappeared while we were eating our meal. The lady who had been refilling our waters took over our table and closed our checks. As we were leaving, we see our server sitting behind the bar, playing on his phone and chatting with other guests.... We probably will not be returning to Toast for dinner. It just seemed way to pretentious and we were not impressed by the food or the 93.5 sanitation grade.</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>6e0khvHCOJU1YTCx8gDfSw</td><td>6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q</td><td>This is always a must visit on vegas trips.

I wish it could have been spicier but in the end I was contently full and very happy with my choice. $14 for the dining experience was well worth it.

My husband and I along with our boys were in SC last weekend for scheduled maintenance on one of our SUV's and since the appointment was so early we rushed out without breakfast so of course the entire time in the waiting area we were searching for food. This place was bookmarked by me so we went to check it out after seeing the menu had Vegan options and our boys and I are Vegan. We arrived and Boy was this place busy, people standing outside waiting for tables and all. I went in to see how the list worked and there was a sheet of paper on the landing with no one manning it and several sets of people in the extremely small (6ppl capacity) entry way. I flagged down a server who then came to take my name and others waiting name down and explained to us all at once how the long table in the middle worked. Basically the table is 1st come 1st served and adding your name to the list put you on wait for the tables around the room on the outer perimeter. We were told 30min so we sat in the car and my husband went inside every 10mins to see if we were coming up since they don't take numbers nor do they have buzzers. I totally don't mind this process at all it seems more down to earth and not commercial. After about 40 plus minutes we got a table and were so hungry and I ordered the chef special vegan dish which was the only Vegan dish on the list. I was immediately told that the chef special was SOLD OUT and that happened about a half hour before I ordered (meaning if we had a seat I wouldn't got to have it ). Mind you it was only like 11:30am *insert Kanye shrug* I read on the specials menu that there was a skillet with lots of yummy veggies that I enjoy and some type of meat, I asked if the skillet could be made for me minus the meat. The waitress agreed so that's what I ordered. My husband ordered a veggie egg while omelet dish with a sweet potato waffle. Our toddler had pancakes and fruit. Look I'm honest so here is the run down on what you we had: Skillet (cauliflower, squash, sweet potato & red peppers) - This we super tasty but extremely small.

It was one of the best brunches I had ever eaten. Alas, my most recent trip did not make nearly as stellar an impression. I brought my mother here for her birthday dinner last month, wanting to share with her the wondrous buffet I remembered. Well, we got off to a bad start. My son fell asleep in the car on the way over (he's five and had been in the pool all day) and I carried him into the restaurant. At the register, I discovered that there was no children's price and that I would be paying more than $30 to enter with my sleeping child. Because it was mom's birthday, I went with it, but I was annoyed. No child is going to eat $30 worth of buffet food. They want the pizza and dessert and not much else. Of course he didn't want to wake up at all and refused to eat much of anything, so I paid for him to sit there and be cranky. My bad. As for the adult meals, the food was fine. I had prime rib, which was only OK, but the mashed potatoes were awesome. My mother had the crab legs which she loved. We must have sampled every dessert they served and each one was better than the last. The waitress was kind of lazy and had to be waved down to refill our water. Really the food was pretty good, so maybe it is just my son's behavior that's coloring my opinion on our meal, but I just can't help but feel like we over paid. There was nothing remarkable offered. The service was iffy, the food was unexceptional. Well, dessert was pretty great, but I don't need to pay almost $100 for my family to eat dessert.

They are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal. We all loved our food, but I'll have to say the Motley Que was the best meal of the night. Damn it! My wife is always bragging about how she's better at ordering, and she did it again here. This place isn't inexpensive, but the portions and quality make it well worth it. We had dinner at BurGR the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot. My only complaint is the hostess staff. They treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. They have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. NEXT! When I asked about the wait after 45 minutes, she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier. I showed her my phone - no text. Well, that also meant no apology from her either.

It offers a dining area for you to sit in and at a table. It also gives you a bar so you can just sit at and enjoy drinks that have been made by the bartender. It offers a variety of food. From entrees like burgers, steak, and fish, and if you are not feeling to hungry then they have appetizers like hot wings, sliders, chips and salsa and so many more options. Also they allow you to order your food from home and pick it up and take it home. I personally like that there is so many options to choose from on the menu. I like how they also cater to the needs of someone trying to be healthy and watch their diet by adding healthy items to the menu. The staff is great and helpful. They don't hang around, and watch you eat. They check in at appropriate times to refill your drinks and ask how you're doing. The only thing I dislike is the waiting time. I usually have to wait 30 minutes to be seated. But that is because I usually go on the weekends, so it is understandable.

Came to Vegas to celebrate a milestone birthday - and Saturday just seemed to want us to be at Encore Beach Club the entire day\\/night. First, we attended Diplo, with some promoter price tickets for the guys and the ladies on a free list. Came around 11 to avoid the line - easy-peasy. We ate there, while letting the sunscreen dry, then spent the whole afternoon dancing and splashing. The staff was great, the people as well- there was hard partying but no fights or any such ratchetness, just people from all over having the time of our lives. The rave-booty was twerk-tacular. There were spankings. The bartenders seemed to be having more fun than the people drinking. All I saw were smiles. You could see Diplo from any of the pools, except perhaps the front middle as people stand and dance in front of the DJ. We danced with our group of 8 (4 couples) and met plenty of nice people. As more of my group came in from all over, we came back for Marshmello Saturday night (Nightswim!), whom I hadn't seen since EDC last year. We got a great table on a lily-pad off the pool (not on the pool) just in case there was gratuitous splashing, we'd want a dry drinking spot haha. Our view was fantastic, table was perfect, the VIP even invited us into the small VIP pool behind us. We got a great package that started with 2 magnums of grey goose, which did great for our group. I was impressed how they handled both my large group (12 on table, 14 total that night) and the speed-bump of my credit-card declining as I forgot to tell the bank I was leaving the state. My Host Alexia, beholder of a supernatural beauty, waited patiently and kindly while I called the card and had them over-ride the security hold. She was calm and pleasant, and simply said \"\"this happens all the time.\"\" (This was in stark contrast to the treatment at Omnia the night before where the bartender threatened to have my friend arrested when his card declined).

Back when Downtown was still a neighborhood where only the most diehard entrepreneurs dared to tread, you could find one of these small neighborhood shops selling everything from wine and beer, to snacks, to cooking essentials, and even a few household cleaning items. The relatively new Pure Fillmore apartment complex is currently the first of what will undoubtedly be many new apartment and condo complexes lining 7th Avenue in Downtown. But for now, the nearest full sized grocery store requires a car. All the more reason URBO's location makes sense. You'll find URBO on the bottom floor of the Pure Fillmore Apartments on Fillmore Street just east of 7th Avenue. The brainchild of DeSoto Central Market alum Shawn Connelly, you enter here through the front patio area (where there's seating for eight by the way). Inside, its a whole lot of stuff mixed into a small space. Behind the counter, you can get coffee, tea, or even a sandwich made on the spot. In front of the counter, it's essentially a small independent convenience store with many of the things you'd expect. Candy bars, meds, condiments, snacks, microwavable items, beer, wine, soda, as well as odds and ends like tissue paper, shampoo, and storage bags. I can well imagine some Downtown college students living in the apartments upstairs too hung over or too tired to drive two miles to Safeway and instead opting for a stop here. For my first stop here on a Saturday morning, I opted to get a quick morning pick me up. A tea and a sandwich. I got their Salted Caramel Iced Tea (also available hot) and their Turkey Sausage Egg & Cheese sandwich on an english muffin. Both made to order. Total cost including tax: $10. Now to be fair, they prepared the sandwich in part using a microwave so we're not talking gourmet here. Still, the sandwich hit the spot and the sausage in particular was very tasty. I was also very happy with the tea. Almost tasted like a southern style sweet tea of sorts with those caramel accents. A solid breakfast. So there you have it. A locally owned business filling a need in an emerging neighborhood. Nothing pretentious. Just a good, straight forward, progressive independent convenience store. Even if you don't live in this quiet corner of Downtown, its worth a look.

Our server was very friendly, but did seem a little awkward and didn't make a lot of eye contact. His recommendations were spot on and we enjoyed all of our food.

I ordered the regular chicken florentine - crepe was cold, doughy and undercooked. It was generously stuffed, almost too much. Spinach was fresh, but not cooked so it was like eating a salad in my crepe...the mushrooms, clearly were canned precooked mushrooms. I'm not totally offended by them, but when you put a ton in a raw crepe...not really tasty. Iced latte- there is no option to NOT add flavoring which is baffling in itself. Flavoring should be a option not a requirement. Given I can't stand sugar filled syrup pretending to be caramel in my coffee, in the special notes section, I specifically asked NO flavoring, and add a extra shot. Guess who got a caramel syrup latte? This girl. Why even have the special requests field if you aren't going to read it? This happened the first time I ordered. I don't know if they can't see the notes or figure it can be put on Postmates. It's all very confusing. Chocolate croissant- tasty, seemed fresh. Nothing special but compared to my $10 crepe and watered down overly flavored latte it shined. Dear management, read your reviews. Common theme, crepes are undercooked. If you are going to be so bold to name your establishment after a certain food, you best knock it out of the park. IHOP makes a better chicken Florentine crepe. That's shameful.

I had the fried chicken and waffles so a little dinner and breakfast in one and my husband had the smaller chicken fried steak. The portions were large.

I don't know if it is different dining in, because I ordered take-out, but it was good. It didn't blow me away, but it was good. Very similar to good chinese take-out, or maybe a notch up. I ordered the Tottie Rolls as a starter. They are crispy egg rolls that you wrap in a lettuce leaf, with mint and parsley. They come with a sort-of sweet and sour sauce for dipping that was quite nice. Or atleast I think that is how you are supposed to eat them? I had a big take out container full of lettuce, mint and parsley, so I figured that was the drill since I didn't order a salad? They were good. I ordered the Tangerine Chicken and the Beef Pad Lard Na. The chicken dish was good, tasted like an orange chicken, deep fried until crispy then tossed in a sweet tangerine sauce. It had a few strips of red bell pepper also. The beef dish I liked a little more, it was the wide egg noodles and had chunks of beef, onion, pea pods and bok choy in a really good brown sauce. You can order many of the dishes mild to HOT, so I did a medium hot since I sharing the dishes I didn't want to blow them out of the water with too spicy of a dish. Next time I will definitely go hotter! The dishes came with 2 containers of sticky white rice, which was exactly what it sounds like. I didn't have any dessert, but the crispy bananas sound great, and I am interested in trying the ice creams I keep hearing about. I also really want to try the soups, they sound good. All in all, it was good (I keep saying good!) the prices are reasonable, and the portions are big. I have enough for lunch leftovers today. So, it is worth giving them a try, and I will be back.</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>DDIMiC69en1Gl3t7EM8MQQ</td><td>OyTSs71uXNDeC14zsPA5jw</td><td>Delicious.

The xiu mai had orange\\/yellow 'eggs' on it which tasted like crab innards\\/tomal\\/mustard; rich and super flavorful. All the dumplings were packed with meat and\\/or seafood and not a lot of fillers (yay!). The only downside is that the offerings are limited\\/uninspired; just the basics.

I would rate 3 1\\/2 vs 3. Really better than ok but I'm not sure that it rates 4 stars. It was a good restaurant but had some pretty big negatives. The first thing that I notice was how large the restaurant was. It seemed to go on forever. Which was amazing considering how quickly our food came out. They have an open kitchen so you can see how many people they have working in the kitchen. Needless to say it's busy. One drawback as others have mentioned is the noise level. Fortunately my husband and I were sitting by drapery panels so the 2 of us could carry on a conversation. Others sitting more towards the inside of the restaurant would have a difficult time hearing each other. Another issue is that it is pretty dark. I understand ambiance but this was a little too much. They know this so they do compensate and make the print larger on the menu. When it came to eating and my food was the same color (fish and cauliflower) it was hard to tell exactly what I was putting on the fork. Our server was very good. Attentive and full of information when clarification was needed for the menu. We had Avocado bruschetta which was just okay. I should of skipped it. I ordered the Pacific Sea Bass. The fish was good and so was the cauliflower. They only thing I didn't care for was the preserved grapefruit. The funny thing is that while eating it I said to my husband that I didn't like the orange flavor that I was sometimes getting on the fish. It was either orange or when they preserve it then it totally changes the taste profile from grapefruit to orange. My husband had the lasagna bolognese. He was happy with his choice. Overall, a good restaurant. I took off since it was extremely dark and loud. Also, the food comes out almost too quick if you just want to sit and talk.

Within five minutes of meeting them, one of them pukes and next thing I know is we are being forced to leave. Did I mention I had to pay $30 + service fee to get in???? But that was just my luck, I can't blame the venue for things like this. Would have been better if they granted re-entry upon the rest of us returning to the pool - no. Sure there are rules and one of them happens to be no re-entry, but absolutely no flexibility? Especially at a place where bouncers ask for $200 to bribe them (yes, this apparently happened earlier in the day to my friends). It's a nightmare trying to take care of a drunk person and get the belongings (one coat check, meaning we had to take other people's belongings too). You are not allowed in the hotel unless you have your bottoms on (reason why we had to get everyone's stuff). I was handed the room key and room number via text because we thought it would be easier to get back in (although chances were very slim) as opposed to two. The security calls for paramedics and they come to do their simple check up. I was pissed and annoyed but they were doing their job so no complaints from a sober person point of view so that was okay. We got the okay to go and I took the friend up to the room. I get back to the Beach Club and explained I had my other friends' stuff AND the room key without which they will not be able to get back into the hotel. I cannot reach the other friend with a phone. Shoot, I'm thinking I'm not coming to Vegas again. One of the security people approached me and asked how my friend was, HOW WONDERFUL HE ASKED! Because I also explained to him my current situation and he talked to the other people at the door and they let me in. See? There is the reasonable flexibility. (hence, two stars, not one) So here is my real experience at Encore Beach Club: There is just too many people. You are just standing in water jumping up and down OR doing the same thing outside the pool. It is too packed. Getting drinks at the bar is unimaginable - the line is just insane. With that many drunk people still drinking, who knows how much pee is present in the water??? The lifeguards are annoying as hell, blowing the whistles for every single thing - no splashing, etc. They all go insanely crazy when a guy gets on the stripper pole area even for a second, I thought an arrest was about to be made with so many whistles going off. If you have no issues dropping the dough you could spend purchasing a very decent DSLR, go for the tables and cabanas with wait service. Otherwise, not worth the entrance fee. By entering here though you have a full excuse to be at the douchiest level possible for guys or to act as if you have no brain for girls so if that's what you want (seemed like that's what everyone else wanted at this place), go here without the $$$$$. Standard party goers in Vegas but this place by far the worst. Lock box is available for $20 by the entrance. Not going back.</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>N1OHFWHQ9YI3u4UHMW12iQ</td><td>Sxx0E2KvnNCSqlIhbD0l_g</td><td>Awesome place. Clubhouse salad is my favorite.

Hands down, Encore Beach Club aka EBC is one of the best day clubs you can go to. One of the MAIN reasons why this is one of the best is that they actually have Gaming Tables. Most Day Clubs don't (actually, I don't think any other day clubs have gaming tables, with the exception of XS but that is a nightclub). So if you're a gambler like me, you're gonna want to go here. Also, If you're going to book a table, I recommend booking the Lilypads. Why? Its on the water so you can chill on your Lilypad and hang out in the water. Best of both worlds in my opinion! You can't order food from your Lilypad but you can order food from the grill and BRING it to your lilypad. So you're good! If you're going to book any tables at EBC, make sure you go through a reputable promoter. I HIGHLY recommend booking with the EBC VIP host Brian Pfeiffer (773) 459-8133 - His cell phone. Just text him! He is AMAZZZINNNGG. He will walk you in, he will make sure you're all good and he will answer all your questions.

It was crowded when we arrived, and the host snapped at us saying it would be another 30 minutes for our reservation. I asked if we could go to the bar while we wait, and she said there was no room there either. So we went to a Casino bar & came back 30 minutes later, and the manager told us it'd be at least another 30 minutes. They weren't at all polite, they acted like we were being a pain for coming back. SERIOUSLY?! So I asked them to take my number down & call me when the table was ready, and she begrudgingly did. Well, they NEVER called me to say our table was ready.... good thing we snagged one at the Burger & Brews place next door.

Instead, we were left wondering and waiting for our food. Obviously that never came until we said we were going to leave and take it with us. You would think at that point they would have apologized or taken something off the check, but no, nothing. Chances are, I won't be back.

Definitely not bad or awful, but maybe if I sandwiched a later supper between undulating bare bellied vixens and a couple of Kingfishers, I'd stumble out with a hazier (and happier ) overall impression. Nothing I've ever eaten here was truly bad enough to take back - or savory enough to inspire a return visit. Portions tend to be small and sauces are, by and large, mild and rather one dimensional. Other than the garlic naan, I cant remember a dish smelling really awesome as it wafted by, which is a shame considering Indian cuisine is among the world's most aromatic. I was eager to share yesterday's lamb boti kabob, as the portion was good sized - about 15-20 small cubes of lamb (not mega kabob sized cubes, but a very respectable portion for $10-11), on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers. The lamb exterior was nice & crusty, but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you'd expect from tandoori - instead it was hard, chewy and disappointing. Companion's entree was 3 tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in a thick sauce, that looked more like an appetizer. Chicken dishes are generally better - the tandoori version is good, and similar to most Indian joints. I recommend the three hot relishes (red sauce, green puree, and pickled peppers) provided tableside, as house preparations, at least in my experience, tend to be mild. Servers are generally Anglo, pleasant and competent during the meal, but just about every time we walk in for dinner at 5 or 5:30, the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence. Nobody's overtly rude, but instead of a really warm welcome, you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at the bar staring at you, as if mentally choosing straws to see who has to deal with the first dinner customer of the evening. It's not oppressive, but it's happened more than once and I'm not crazy about the vibe. I do like the complimentary, self serve chai tea and open kitchen, providing an opportunity to stretch one's legs and socialize a bit. Nice touches. The menu is extensive, all told about sixty items, and reasonably priced for Indian food. Indian textiles, jewelry and artwork is often on display, for sale, and the house music is too loud if you have the misfortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker. It got turned down, eventually, but any restaurant with a few years under it's belt ought to understand customary American tolerances better than that. The atmosphere is up and down. Food's OK. Service is OK. Ask my family and they'll each give it four or five stars.

It was loud as hell inside, and then the bellydancing made any conversation entirely inaudible to the point where i had to ask my 'server' what he said numerous times. Now aside from letting children play with a massive sword by other guests, balancing candles on her head, and harassing patrons to get up and dance with her, the bellydancing was not only dangerous but unnecessarily noisy.

It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling. The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition. Indeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip. While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at. The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious. Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point). The property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos). The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience. I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing. We went off-peak (during the week) and felt the room rates were a good deal. If I ever go back to Vegas, I'll consider staying again.</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>HESaRyiBfIrrUE3ycYBMmg</td><td>EJs6fYFdecCjXq8pCsA2dA</td><td>Food is awesome! Been eating there since 2000.

The issue I persistently have with chicken is that it is not usually well seasoned. But the chicken at this place was wonderfully well seasoned. I mean even the bits closest to the bone are just as well seasoned as the surface meat. So every bite was absolutely delicious! It was very tender and moist and not overly greasy. I come from the South and I have not had better fried chicken! I ordered their Blue plate. I was doubtful about spiced watermelon with chicken. (I mean watermelon on a main dish with chicken?!?). But once I had it, it totally made sense! The sweetness and juiciness of watermelon goes delightfully with the fried chicken; it kinda acts as a palette cleanser and takes away any feeling of greasiness. Totally yum! Honestly, I think I'd always try fried chicken with watermelon after this. Don't be put off by this unusual combo! The spiced watermelon isn't overly spiced. I tasted salt, pepper and cilantro. It's very refreshing. Only issue: portion sizes are little small compared to the usual American size portions.

It's not a long drive for any local since it's conveniently located near the 215\\/15. There are a lot of stores and here and a large variety of store types. I like to come here for work clothing since they have several stores with good prices on dress pants and blouses (Ann Taylor Loft\\/Van Heusen). The Clark's store is a favorite since that is my primary shoe brand. It's pretty awesome to get a deal on a brand I was already planning to buy. I also love the Harry & David store for gourmet foods. Look for Starbucks in one of the middle aisles for caffeine. The food options inside are dismal, but there are some okay food options in the parking lot in front of the mall. This place can get really busy. I find the mall to be pleasant for an hour or two after opening, but just generally miserable after that time. I would recommend planning out which stores you'll visit and setting time limits to get the heck out of Dodge before all hell breaks loose. The parking lot can be insane. As a local I can say that I hate even driving by here in the middle of the day during my lunch break. Wow, there is a lot happening here. People jaywalking, tourists making crazy lefts onto Warm Springs (just use the LV Blvd. exit!), and just general chaos.

My parents had a Chinese restaurant when I was younger and the egg foo yung at Chino's tastes just like my dad used to make, right down to the gravy on top. I finally tried the Chinese BBQ pork a couple weeks ago and it was surprisingly good. Not authentic, but it had a nice flavor. I also like the emerald chicken, jerk chicken, and carnitas.

Then a waitress walked through the back and looked at us, I thought for sure she was coming up front. Wrong. She walked back and forth, didn't acknowledge our presence.

He completely ignored the fact we were there. At that point we left. We went across the street to Village Inn (full parking lot btw).

I'm not entirely sure when this place opened but I knew it was fairly new. Either way, I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The atmosphere and everything seemed great. When my food arrived and I took a bite, I realized I had been given the wrong dish as this one was called the Sandi Benedict and had spinach in it. It wasn't a huge deal to me. I really just wanted avocado, so I let the waitress know I had been given the wrong plate. She said she'd fix it and went to the back. I decided to stop eating as I wasn't sure if they were just bringing avocado or if they were bringing a whole plate out. After about 5 minutes of my boyfriend eating and me waiting, a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. I replied that yes as the waitress said she was handling it. Another 5-10 go by and I hadn't heard anything. I was hungry and now my food was cold so I just started eating it. Finally, the waitress comes out and asks if the manager handled my issue. I told her that I told the manager she was handling it. She ran off to figure it out I guess. I ate my cold food and was very unhappy. The manager came over later and apologized and told me that the waitress hit the wrong item on the tablet and they are so busy with trainees that it was chaotic. She gave me a $13 voucher and did not charge me for my meal. She assured me that it isn't normally like that, so I accepted this and planned to return in the future. I would like to mention that the food was good, but the experience wasn't. I returned just this last Saturday intending to use the voucher and give them go #2. We had a young male server this time. He was nice and polite. I asked him how their herbal tea is (as that is all it was listed as on menu) and he said he hadn't tried it but knows it's some sort of seasonal harvest blend. I agreed to try it. When he brought it and ran off, I noticed he brought me coffee. I waited for him to come back around. I'm really trying at this point to give this place a chance but it was striking out again already. When he finally returned I clarified that I asked for tea, to which he said he thought I asked for coffee and he said he'd bring the tea. When the tea came, the water in the pot was basically almost room temperature. It was just lukewarm. I was sort of done trying so I just lived with it. I ordered the same thing I intended to have the last time. When the food finally came, my hash browns were nice and hot, but the eggs were again room temperature. Not even the slightest bit warm. I didn't complain. I just ate my cold food and made the decision I won't be returning any time soon. Again, the food is good (Should be at least warm) but my experiences here have not been the best. Maybe I'll give this place a year or so to get things together before returning. I've never been anywhere where I have had back to back not so great experiences.

I was out with my sister when we realized we were hungry, and were in the mood to have a beer or glass or wine with dinner, I couldn't remember if Doan's was serving yet so I called while on the road and a woman informed me they do sell beer and wine, but not liquor. Worked for us. My sister is also a vegetarian and although I couldn't remember if I saw a veg section in the menu, we did find one online so we figured we were safe, and then we arrived... First, our waitress informed us they don't serve alcohol yet. Um, okay? After a ridiculous wait to get someones attention to ask if they had a veg menu supplement, we were informed by a waiter that they used to, but have since chucked it. Great. Unfortunately he was unwilling to point us in any direction or give us any veg friendly options. Okay, back to the menu. I ordered the rocket shrimp and the bun with chik\\/pork\\/springrolls (after they informed me they don't serve the banh xeo listed on their menu). My sister ended up ordering the wonton soup with tofu\\/veg and the tofu\\/veg pad thai. My food was fine, but for her, she ended up with a plain wonton soup and the seafood pad thai. If it hadn't taken so long to get the first round of food she would have sent it back, and the waitress was very grateful she didn't want to send it back and that she agreed to pick around the seafood and eat the dish. My sister then asked for a few steamed veggies on the sides to supplement the lack of vegetables in her pad thai, the waitress agreed without issue. Everything seemed okay, though the veggies arrived in a completely different sauce, but when we got the bill I was a little surprised. Not only did we have to pay for the seafood pad thai that we clearly did not order (and all the seafood was left stacked on the side of the plate), we also had to pay for the side of vegetables! seriously?? It was only a few dollars more in the end, but included with the lack of service (in a fairly empty restaurant), there are just better places in town to get great tasting Vietnamese food with better service. Sorry Doan's, maybe next time.</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>-d2xPMwNchb7Mq62YCXnpg</td><td>PJerxJc0SN9h6hXlqSQc5w</td><td>Great food, service, and ambiance! Cool during the day or night.

I had heard of the restaurant before on my travels to Montreal, but never got around to it. Montreal for the record is a foodie wonderland. Although this restaurant is priced high, in Vegas terms I would say it's average. The service, ambiance and location are exceptional and the food couldn't be more perfect. I usually have some sort of critique on what could be better, and this time all I can say is that if they could make the meal never end. The best way to experience Milos is via their tasting menu. I started with their grilled octopus which is one of the best I've had (other than in Montreal of course). The flavor and texture of their octopus is just right and the portion perfect. For my main I went with the lobster pasta, which was equally delicious as my starter and equally well executed. If I could eat this dish every day, I would. Dessert was a baklava walnut cake topped with honey ice cream. Delicious and a perfect ending. I can see why this restaurant is considered one of the best Mediterranean ones in the world - with locations in London, Athens, New York, Miami, Las Vegas and Montreal.</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>jJKirx_OVZCFL-wHw43Y2w</td><td>VoXUt6TIJWyIf_lihbN5xQ</td><td>Really great little lunch spot.

The owner has paid attention to interiors but if it is supposed to be depict fine dining, bar and lounge then they need to do something more than just hanging the chandelier from the top. It is not a nice view when you look up because I have never been to a fine dining and lounge space that has undone ceiling. Looks very cheap. Service was good. Food could have been better. Their raspberry ginger mojito was very good. Their pan seared scallops which they claim is one of their signature dishes was overcooked. The presentation although was very good. Their zucchini fries were average with no salt. Their spicy seafood pasta which again they claim is one of their signature dishes was average. Pasta was overcooked. They had some mussels and tiny shrimps for the sake of calling it seafood pasta. Restaurants like this should not cut corners in preparing food like this. We didn' t like their cheap cheese grater. I have better ones at home. Their creme brulee was a disaster. Looks like the chef made no efforts to serve it fresh. It had an overdose of vanilla essence. The caramelized sugar coating was cold, thick and extremely sweet. The caramelization part is supposed to be done just before serving. Little did we know they serve it pre made. Very disappointing. We have been to some of the best food places all over the country. So when it comes to restaurants we pay attention to many details.

Highlight: The bruschetta rocked my world in ways I did not know it could be rocked. The Vibe: unique and welcoming. This is a small restaurant with seats for around 30 people inside and maybe 15-20 outside. Combined with plain wooden tables and fun cutlery, makes this an intimate experience. The middle of the room has what appears to be a homemade chandelier made from glass jars. One wall has a large vertical fern garden (with real ferns!). It was well put together without overstating itself. I love it! Jack Johnson was playing in the background, which added to the relaxed theme. The Service: Wow! These were some of the most attentive and knowledge staff I have experienced. I never wanted for water (which came with a hint of cucumber). The sourcing of menu specials were described (cheese from the Goat Lady). The server that we had was pleasantly talkative and I could see great opportunities for small talk, if that is your thing. Very courteous and friendly! The Food: - Bruschetta (deserving of 3 paragraphs): I am not a bruschetta guy; however, this was hands down the most delicious appetizer I have ever had. This appetizer lived up to the name and actually stimulated my appetite. In fact, we both were left craving more throughout the dinner to the point of seriously considering getting one more order for dessert (it's not sweet, just THAT good)! This aint no red paste\\/salsa looking glob on a bread. No, it was asparagus, tomato, lion's mane mushroom (and some more veggie yumminess that eludes me at the moment) perfectly seasoned on a crispy, garlicky, buttery slice of bread. The only possible downside is that the restaurant changes its bruschetta daily (or maybe weekly), so future experiences may differ. However, I fully place my bruschetta trust in the chief to deliver and WILL be ordering the bruschetta in the future. - Arugula salad: This came with arugula, walnuts, pumpkin, and pumpkin seeds with a pomegranate dressing. The portioning of the salad seemed in-between a side salad and dinner salad. Definitely get a side or appetizer (bruschetta mayhaps...) if you are hungry. Whereas certainly not bad, we both found the pomegranate dressing to be a bit too intense and sweet--overpowering the other flavors. - CM Burger: solid veggie patty with toasted wheat bun. The patty was particularly enjoyable because it was not trying to be like a hamburger in texture or taste. This resulted in a crispy on the outside patty of veggie awesome. The toppings were fantastic. Only drawback was that the patty tends to fall apart easily, but this minor inconvenience is well worth the effort. Would get again! - Side of Veggies: the burger came with a choice of sides. I choose the veggies, which contained squash, zucchini, carrot, onion, and green beans. These were sauteed perfectly, not soggy like defrosted mixed veggies. The green beans could have been cooked a bit longer, but a minor issue. Deliciousness comes at a price though--butter. And lots of it. Veggies can only taste this sinfully good with a large amount of butter. It didn't bug me at all, but it may be a concern to others. Overall: Coming back again. Soon. Even though not a vegetarian, I really appreciate well-prepared vegetarian food. There is a lot of variety and unique flavors at Fern and I am not done exploring yet.</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>ae3gq_tGgur14yjnuTnSVA</td><td>hhhHgSaSl6GLtuDoDrMUZQ</td><td>This is a great local bar!!

The restaurant is in a sketchy area of town, literally right next door a strip club. They're located in a run down building, which still reeks of the days it spent as a Chinese restaurant. Everything is in disrepair: there is a large piece of plywood in the middle of the front door, perhaps from a prior break-in?, the carpet is worn down to nothingness, the fluorescent lights are overwhelming, and blinding, which exposes and magnifies every fault of the restaurant. There is nothing cohesive about the interior of this restaurant, and the senses are left confused and probably offended. The menu is decent, it is after all a sandwich shop. The po-boys all sound enticing, with everything from crawfish and oysters, to turkey and gravy, and even a vegetarian option. The sweet tea is authentic, and the servers are incredibly warm and welcoming, and after ordering, for a brief moment, you're left feeling optimistic. But here again, the weird, decrepitness of the restaurant messes everything up. You find yourself sitting in weird booths that seem to have come out of a 1950s diner, being served drinks in Caesar's Palace cups, staring at open shelving that's yellowed over time, and now contains a hodgepodge of low-quality bulk restaurant items. Heat lamps are hung clumsily from yellow chains, low-quality, inkjet printed signs are posted everywhere, the kitchen doors seem to be bloated from water damage, and there's a pervasive odour of old Chinese food mixed with mould. It's sad, and I was waiting to see Gordon Ramsey come screaming out of the kitchen, cursing everything. The food, was mediocre at best.

She said Dr. Tran always order Korean boiled eggs when he's here and it's delicious. My food came out in 25 to 30 min but it was nice that they give complementary chips and salsa.

This place just blew our minds this morning...hubby and I came in a little after 9am because other places we drove by were just stupid packed and we wanted to sit somewhere comfortable and low key with good food. I've been eyeing this place for a while now and what a perfect time to try them out. We sat by the window, we had a new waitress but she did great with timely service and great interaction. They serve chips with a yummy banana nutella spread while you wait for your meals. We ordered tosilog for the hubby, green eggs and spam for me and shortstacks to share. The meals were delicious and hit the spot for us...we were so into our dishes that we didn't even get a chance to dig into the shortstacks - we ended up taking them home for a later splurge. I was a little bummed that they upped the prices by a couple dollars from what is listed on their website (someone needs to UPDATE that stat), but in the end it was still worth it. Eggs were cooked perfectly for both meals, the green thai butter used on mine gives it a nice kick of flavor and spice. Spam pieces were fried just right, not underdone (yes, this is possible) and not overdone. The tocino was marinated pork belly - again, great flavor and texture. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the little details incorporated into each dish...garnishing was spectacular! The chef even came by our table to check on how everything turned out - that was a very nice touch...From other reviews, it looks like kitchen efficiency can be a hit or miss I guess depending on when you get there - glad we got there when we did, because when we left, the crowd certainly picked up and it appears that the kitchen got backed up from what another review states of their experience from today as well - I remember seeing that couple come in with their baby, it's too bad they didn't get a spectacular experience. Hubby was greatly impressed with this place and that says a lot as it's very hard to please him.

Not that my first experience wasn't spectacular. It was, but I really steeped in it my fiance this weekend for brunch, and it isn't that our meals were just perfect, it's that the service was very friendly and attentive, as well. My fiance ordered the Eggs Benedict with breakfast potatoes, and I had the Bacon Cheeseburger with a side salad. He cleaned his plate, and ate whatever he could of the half burger I couldn't finish. His only comment was that he preferred the hollandaise a different way, but that's because we make it ourselves at home. The Bacon Cheeseburger was amazing, I order it medium. If I could have finished the entire thing I would, and the red wine vinaigrette on the side of greens is the best I've had in a while. I'd love to be able to make that one at home! We ended the meal with the strawberry shortcake dessert that was interesting...not what either of us was expecting, then again, not sure what we were expecting. It was good. I'm sure there are better choices. Our waiter really made sure we were comfortable, enjoying our brunch and our experience. We walked out of there smiling, stopping by the marketplace to order the large Cactus Blossom iced tea on the way out.</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>6SCmSjhU4DGnNw_7ZRBkkg</td><td>gE07l6v5mp5TPM4awcm5Xg</td><td>Done, gone, repossessed!

Definitely not a bad deal at all. The buffet is ok, but really nothing to write home about. We got there right as breakfast was ending, so I won't blame them for running out of several things. Breakfast selection looked pretty standard (breakfast meats, pastries, omlet station, etc). There were also a few entrees and some desserts out, but I'm not sure if those were already being put out for lunch, or if they had them out during breakfast as well. The blueberry pancake was amazing (not standard individual pancakes, more of a bluberry pancake batter baked into a dish and scooped out with a spoon). Lunch was decent...there was nothing in particular that stood out, although the desserts were pretty good (loved the chocolate tart). Similarly, dinner was reasonably good but there was nothing that was particularly amazing or stood out. The roast beef at the carving station was probably my favorite.

That's the texas trinity, and I never expected to have it be so good in Arizona. Bravo! Sides: I tried the beans, potato salad, and grits. Beans were slightly too thick for me.

I did make a special request as far as the items on the burger and also to have them cut in half.

No cars in front of me or behind me in drive-thru, but I had a semi-long wait. I was ok with that since most restaurants of the like make it fresh and it's worth it. Burrito was a great size for the price, the green chile sauce was okay. But the meat was dry and stringy and not saturated\\/infused with green chile as if it had been marinating all day, like it should. Maybe this is just not their winner and I'll try something different another time probably, especially since it's so close to my work.</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>0mJsZeA0Fgsgg6sItYmpvw</td><td>9ae7asMUB-Fty3tw6m18qQ</td><td>Only heard bad things about this place but was fighting a hangover and you know what that means....time to get my pho on.

We visit this place about once a month, as a treat. The staff is always super nice and chill. The burgers are always cooked to perfection and put together neatly with the fixins! I usually order the small fat with skinny fries. I have tried the onion rings, and they were delicious, but it started to be too much to eat after I finish a delicious fatburger. I learned that this chain is in each Station casino, minus Boulder Station. I haven't visited those locations. I'm really glad this location isn't too far from our apt. :) They have a frequent visitor card thing. You get a stamp for each fatburger you purchase, and it's double stamps on Tuesdays.

Here's what I ordered for 2 people: 1) sea bass and miso antichucos....the Peruvian corn that comes with it was quite tasty 2) agedashi tofu....3 fried tofu, 1 asparagus and 1 mushroom in some sort of sauce. this was probably the most normal item that we ate on the menu....but it was still good. 3) bobo brazil samba roll. this was quite interesting...seared kobe beef roll. 4) some sort of spicy tuna roll. the tuna was high quality...VERY FRESH! 5) Peruvian hot chocolate....this was DAMN good! The drink was thick and very creamy. 6) Mango honey crisp taquito. thinking of the food makes me drool wishing i could have it again. the service there was EXCELLENT! waiters clean your table and fill your water before you even have to ask. they were very attentive and not smothering.

I feel a SNOBBY vibe when I go here now and before it was very comfortable. The food is NOT CONSISTENT. I've had the scallops when they have been amazing and I've also had them when they have been rubbery. Whenever I order the grain power salad it's never consistent in portion size, the last time I took it to go, it wasn't enough food for a child, also the dressing sometimes has no flavor. For the prices they are charging (And NOT ORGANIC) I at least want my portion size to be consistent and the flavor to be amazing every time.

The meat was prepared to spec, and required no additional seasoning or additives - nor was it over-prepared or over-salted. At the end of the night, the bill was more reasonable than I expected.

The things that stood out on the menu were some Filipino dishes that you're not used to seeing at any restaurant that serves sushi. According to the waiter, the head chef is a Filipino guy. The waiter did a very good job selling the stuff to us, but as a Filipino, I certainly knew better than to pay $18 for six pieces of lumpia, or $20 for some pancit. I'm sure the chef cooks them well, but those two dishes should never cost that much unless you have enough to feed an army. Most of what we ordered was less than memorable and what really stood out were the steaks. The filet came out rare and the ribeye came medium rare. Both were amazing!

We had a reservation at 6 and were able to get seated right as the place was about to get slammed. First thing you walk in, there is no host station and you have to just hope one of the staff members will approach you to get your table. Once we sat down it was roughly a 10-15 minute wait until we were greeted. They gave us our menus and then after about another 10 minutes they dropped off 2 waters for 3 people. Eventually everyone was able to get their own beverage and we ordered appetizers. We started off with the Garlic Naan and Chicken Dip. The Garlic Nan was light and airy with a crisp finish. Really enjoyed it with the Chicken Dip. The dip itself was flavorful and the chicken was prepared nicely. It was a really good start to the meal from a food perspective. For our entrees we had the Saag Spinach with shrimp, Chicken Curry and Chicken Tikka. The Saag Spinach had a nice spice to it and a velvety texture. It combined savory flavor with the spice and went well with the rice they provided. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, big and juicy. The naan also went well with this dish as the saag has a stew-like consistency. Chicken Curry is one of the first dishes I picture when thinking about Indian food and we were not disappointed. This was also a very spicy dish as we requested but the spice did not overwhelm the other flavors. The chicken fit in perfectly and was also accompanied by rice. The dish as a whole was very impressive and the spice blend was second to none. The Chicken Tikka is essentially a whole roasted chicken with dark and white meat. We got a side of hot sauce for the chicken which was laid upon a bed of sautéed vegetables. The hot sauce lived up to its name and was a great compliment to the chicken which was dusted in an array of spices. The chicken was juicy on the inside and had crispy skin. It is also a good sized portion. The food was really good and it was ashame that the service was so bad. Drink refills were not done without multiple requests, and while they were busy, its not an excuse to just ignore your tables. But it wasn't reserved just for us, the table directly next to us did not see a server for at least 20 minutes and had to actually grab their own menus. With the food being so good I was willing to overlook the bad service but things got even worse. Upon paying the bill, the server hovered over us as we attempted to sign the check. Right as we set the pen down after signing the check, we were told to leave. The quote I believe was \"\"we are really busy and need you to leave right now.\"\" It took me a moment to process that we were being kicked out of the restaurant due to their inability to handle good business. I grew up in the restaurant business and have held a variety of roles and had never seen nor heard of guests being told to leave the moment they sign the bill in order to get another table sat. At most we just wanted to take a moment to relax and finish our beverages but we obliged as I knew if I stayed any longer I would have had to say something about being treated like that. I can forgive inattentiveness when a restaurant is busy</td><td> but blatant disrespect is another thing. Its a shame as the entire party enjoyed the food but we all agreed that that was our first and last visit to the Marigold Maison if you are kicked out of the restaurant the moment you pay your bill. The two stars is out of respect to the efforts of the kitchen staff which were impressive.\"</td></tr><tr><td>bu3qhZXlxkWir0EzC2txBQ</td><td>arv3T_av9OoVo3SvxV4TXw</td><td>After seeing the photos of the bacon tempura, we had to give this place a try!

I was not impressed. 1st the ordering system is really out of the ordinary and complicated when trying to order for 6 people. They have 3 different lines for specific types of tacos so if you are wanting to try different types you will have to stand in all three lines. The thing that really upset me was the terrible service. I mentioned to the lady who was walking around that it was my first time visiting and she shrugged her shoulders and didn't offer me any direction on how to order. I finally figured it out after watching other people order so I got in line. 2nd the guy making the tacos was super rude and almost annoyed at the fact that I was ordering different types of tacos. 3rd when I finally made it to the register to pay I had to wait until the girl at the register was done talking to another employee about how she couldn't wait to get out of work. I'm standing there holding a tray with 25 tacos and she doesn't even bother to say one moment please they just ignore me as if I'm not even there. 4th the food was cold because the meats are sitting in a bin and all they do is chop it up when you order it, they don't even reheat it. I'm assuming the holding bin is suppose to keep the meats hot but it wasn't. Qualify of meat gets a C. Flavor gets a D. Service gets an F.

The first time they had a tough time because there was a group of eight people who got there before us, and there was so little wait staff that everything took a very long time. Just eight people! Anyway, I had the seafood pho. The broth was very good, and I would say it was on a par with Saigon 8, which is one of the best. The bowl of pho was interesting in a good way. The fish pieces were actual good sized pieces of fish, not fish balls. There were even baby octopus. I was there a second time about a week later. Service was faster. However, there was a bit of a screw up by the waitress. We got two bowls, and they weren't meant for our table. I'd have eaten it anyway, and even put in sprouts, sauces, and so on. I suppose I'd forgotten just what I'd ordered. Then it was taken away. My pho was pretty good, and by the way, I never saw that waitress again. By comparison with other Viet Pho restaurants, there are differences. They use lacquered chop sticks, rather than throw-away wooden ones as used by Saigon 8 and Pho Little Saigon. The lacquered ones look classy, but are harder to use. Tougher to hold onto the noodles. Unlike other places, they bring the spoons and small empty dishes later, along with the meal. My problem with that is that I cannot mix my dipping sauce while waiting for the rest of the stuff. Also, they don't immediately bring out sprouts and greens and sliced peppers, which come out just before the pho. I like using the sprouts to dip into the dipping bowl, kind of like you would do in a Mexican restaurant. I know, it's just a whim of mine, but that's what I like to do.

We stayed in 2 connecting suites that were very spacious and gave us enough room to be comfortable. The entire hotel is massive and is almost like a big mall. There's a ton of restaurants that serve all different kinds of food that everyone can find something to eat. The Venetian is placed in a good spot on the Strip where we were able to walk to other hotels and see a lot of different areas. The look inside the hotel is gorgeous to the point that there are places inside the hotel that you actually feel like you're in Italy. I've been to Italy and there are some places in the hotel where I actually caught myself thinking I was back in Italy. If there was one negative it's that to get around the hotel or to get from your hotel room to outside the hotel it's a pretty big walk which I expected, but still after a long day of walking around to have to get to the hotel only to realize you have to walk a while longer to get back to your room was a bit of an annoyance.

We were seated after a few minutes of waiting, since there was almost a full house that night. The lighting and ambiance was very nice and casual, and their seats were very comfortable too. We ordered drinks, as well as some of their popular dishes: Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles and the Shrimp and Grits. For a starter, we ordered the waiter's recommendation of their crab cakes. The crab cakes were super fresh and delicious. We popped them into our mouths and had to discipline ourselves to enjoy them to the fullest because the plate only had four of them. The cakes were paired with fresh greens and a tasty sauce, making a plate full of different textures. The food was savory, salty, sweet, and each taste didn't clash with one another. Just a warning though, like I said, the dish only contained four of them, so if you eat them up too quickly, you may end up regretting it! The Shrimp and Grits dish was actually the first time I've ever tried grits before, and because of this, I now have high expectations for grits! Hahaha! Again, I have to say that this dish was also savory too (I love savory food). If only I could order more grits because those grits were just very fluffy and delicious! The shrimp was good too and both complimented each other very nicely. I would definitely come back to this place and order this dish again and again! My friend ordered their most popular dish, Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles (I think that's how it's sequentially ordered...either way, you'll know what I'm talking about once you take a look at the menu yourself!). I especially LOVED this dish because it was their own twist on chicken and waffles. It's been almost two weeks, since eating there, so all I can remember is that it was one of the best chicken and waffles combination I've ever had. Their fried chicken was very crispy (I would have tried to request crispier skin, but I was already too hungry to wait for them to edit the dish), the waffles were sweet (even sweeter when doused in their maple syrup), and the watermelon was juicy! I do wish, however, that the dish had the full plate of waffles, instead of only using half of what was made in a waffle maker. For that price (around $33), they could have definitely added one more fried chicken and the other half of the waffles from the waffle maker.

I considered it to be over hyped and overrated; however, after a very satisfying early Saturday lunch, I now feel completely different. We arrived at 11:00AM and were seated immediately, fortunately in Melissa's section. We had a $50 gift card to play with. We started things off with a very tasty beet and goat cheese salad for $7.95. Fresh and warm honey wheat and sourdough loaves were also served and were very satisfying. For our entrees, my wife ordered the smoked salmon which was thinly sliced and doused with a balsamic glaze for $11.95, and I ordered the French country salad with chicken for $15.95. Both were quite good. We intentionally kept things light, knowing that we were each going to do some serious damage to cheesecake for dessert. As an admitted dessert snob, I did have my doubts regardless of the fact that cheesecake was their specialty. I never consider any dessert unless it's made in house and most of the time they are not. After drooling over the choices on the menu and in the display case, we finally settled on the Oreo and the praline. Slices are huge and run a very reasonable $7.95 when compared to similar restaurants. More importantly, they were other worldly! The Oreo cheesecake had fresh crunchy Oreos baked in, an Oreo crust and was topped with crushed Oreos and fresh whipped cream. The praline was equally as good and was topped with Nutella and fresh creme. No we didn't finish them both but we sure did enjoy them there and at home. I am nonsmoker, and never have, but I almost had to have a cigarette afterwards. Yes it was that good! Hey what can I say, I was wrong. No wonder people wait 2 hours to dine here. I won't do that anywhere no matter how great but I will return for another 11:00 Saturday lunch. By the way, when we left at 1:00 there was a 2 hour wait. Overall, menu was huge, the food was great, the cheesecake incredible, service provided by Melissa was attentive and helpful, and the atmosphere was comfortable and fun.

The most tender and juicy fried chicken I've had to date, the waffles crisp and flavorful. I prefer my fried chicken to be full of spice, but this was an excellent rendition! A bit spendy, but worth the go ahead with the large sharing portion. Mama's Chicken Biscuits ($14): Free Range Fried Chicken, Pepper Jelly, House Pickles & Buttermilk Biscuit. Incredibly fluffy, buttery sweet biscuit with lightly battered chicken, moist and flavorful. Recommended! I could eat these biscuits for days :D Low & Slow Smoked Chicken Salad ($16): Haas Avocado, Warm Cornbread & Yogurt Dressing. Loved the cornbread texture and flavor, the chicken full of flavor and pairing perfectly with the yogurt dressing. Wonderful! Fried Green Tomato 'BLT' ($14): Pork Belly, Greens, Tomato Jam & Pimento Cheese. Succulent pork belly, fat rendered and buttery, with a nice crunchy cornbread and pimento pulling it together. Fried Bread & Butter Pickle Spears ($6): Spicy Salt & Spiked Dukes Mayo. Light breading, similar to Fish & Chips consistency. Dipping mayo very enjoyable! Deviled Eggs ($11): Fresh Dill & Smoked Trout Roe. Well balanced and fresh, the roe adding just a hint of salt to finish Chicken Liver Toast ($5): Grilled Country Bread, Cuke & Fresno Pepper Relish. Mildly mineral in flavor, the acid in the relish complimented well. Florida Heirloom Tomatoes ($16): Toasted Peanut Hummus, Basil, Smoked Tomato Sorbet, Field Shoots, Crunchy Puffed Ca. Dressing was very enjoyable with a nice addition of peanut hummus Macaroni & Cheese ($10): Torchio Pasta, Five Artisanal Cheeses & Crispy Herb Crust. Well rendered, just missing some spice to set it off from the cheese. Country Pork Terrine ($10): Pickled Cauliflower, Grilled Country Bread & Whole Grain Mustard. Very heavy and lunch-meat like terrine, it paired well with the mustard. And for dessert : Key Lime Donut Bites: Coconut Pudding & Mango Jellies. Interesting combination with the citrus, I enjoyed the pudding \\/ mango jelly, light and delicate. Crunch & Munch Bread Pudding: M&Ms Bread Pudding, Popcorn Ice Cream & Candied Pretzel. Incredibly sweet, the bread pudding was thick and rich, almost brownie-like. A bit too sweet for my tastes, but one can figure that out reading the ingredients. Bacon Butterscotch Cake: Pecan Pie Filling & Bourbon Ice Cream. Delicious cake, fair bacon flavor throughout, with a very crispy bacon piece for garnish. Good! Stick with the fried chicken, biscuits and cornbread concoctions, and you will fare well! Eat up :)</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>BfzV88ox1dZTZETtlKwJqA</td><td>zuwba6QEBIDZT0tJZmNhdQ</td><td>Kobe Sushi never disappoints! I literally inhale all that I order here.

I seriously could not decide what to order! I wanted to try so many things...the crab cakes, the clams with white wine, dijon, and garlic bread, the albacore sashimi with white truffle ponzu, the lobster mac and cheese (although my server was informed they were out while I was giving her my order so that solved my problem), or the crab gumbo served over rice. I wasn't super hungry so I went with the clams (my server suggested I get that) and a wedge salad. They also give you these mini biscuits and corn bread muffins beforehand.

Very cool that you can see the grill and I enjoy the laid-back atmosphere. Bar is optional and they do have the newer style coke machine which is a nice option if you drink soft drinks. The wings are some of the best in the valley! Zipps are my favorite, so you get a gist of what type of wings I like. The ranch here is the real deal as well, which makes a difference. Not bottled or bagged ranch like many of the restaurants use. The ONLY issue I have here is that the burgers are cooked WELL done. Xtra well my visit yesterday. BUT, still are great because of the charbroil flavor. I usually order my burgers rare to medium rare (don't have that option here), so I'd rather get a burger at Fuddruckers, but the fries are better here... and the wings and other sides are great options that separate OHW from other restaurants.

On my previous visits I've had the hummus which is always a great choice (the Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus is my fav), the portabello burger was ok. A bit hard to eat. Not sure I'd have it again. The Hummus with Chicken was tasty, the Nachos are HUGE and very good. The soups are great too. Like I said, anything you get here is great and very fresh and tasty. The inside isn't very big so tables are very close to each other while you can opt to sit outside. I usually sit outside even in the hot summer months because it is shaded and there are misters so it's actually not bad and you get full services outside. One downside to this location is the parking like others have said. There is never enough parking for all the dining choices that are located in this shopping center.

(When I dropped by all of the staff were clearly either teenagers or very early 20's.) The cashier laughed and told the rest of the staff who all had a chuckle over this. Overall, the staff was nonchalant and indifferent. Not necessarily rude but perhaps uncaring. I do hope they don't film each other bathing in the sinks after closing.

We shared a handful of oysters with a mild jalapeño sauce. They could have been a bit briny-ier for my taste. And for entrees, we hit opposite ends of the taste spectrum: I had the pork carnitas, which was mild and sweet, with avocado, cole slaw, and a corn 'pancake,' with only a bit of red onion to balance it out. My friend had the jambalaya, which looked deliciously comforting, but she reported the chicken was dry and overcooked and the shrimp was underseasoned. The bite I tasted was too hot (spice-wise, not temp) for me. The decor was comforting in a British pub style.

But the service is just too bad. Wish they take a little bit more pride in the place because it's just right down the street from my house on main street. The food is hit or miss. The salmon salad I got was a huge mess! Salmon tasted old, over seasoned, super thin, just iceberg lettuce and standard grocery store dressing. Avocado was fresh and yummy though. It was nice to have chips and salsa included. The salsa was great, but overall this place is not worth the risk with Nunthaporn across the street and the great Republica Empanada just down the street on Hibbert and first Avenue.</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>eXB51S2eFWPTYLnJIqLW5Q</td><td>Q0EZmATxDphzRMszNV2LVg</td><td>My friend and I went here after church. I had been to a Wildflower in Flagstaff, years ago. I had breakfast; eggs, two sausage links, potatoes and coffee. The coffee was Guatemalan, and was killer good. Eggs were scrambled perfectly. The sausages were huge, and VERY good, but a bit too spicy for me (I'm a wimp). I ate the better part of one sausage before I had to stop. But the star of the breakfast was the potatoes - chunky with rosemary and sea salt. So simple, yet SO delicious. I will get the breakfast with bacon next time, as they serve applewood smoked. The toast was their 9-grain, and it was so good, I bought a loaf. And they used real butter on the bread!

Obviously getting out of boring old Phoenix was a must, but I am talking about driving all the way just for Rincon De Buenos Aires. This place has great variety especially to those unfamiliar with Argentine cuisine. Their empanadas were exactly how I remember them to be when I lived down in Argentina.

It's Arby's, so either you like it or not. As for me, I will take a pass for future lunch decisions. There really is not much quality in this market. But, if I have to have fast food, you can do worse then Arby's. On a positive note, Arby's usually get my order correct and they offer some not to greasy options. I particularly like the beef and cheddar, which is a little better than most offering as a drive through. The beef and cheddar sandwich was hot and fresh and what you would expect from an Arby's. However, my fries were cold, tasteless, an old as if they've were sitting there for quite a while The customer service was fine but the closing of the store wasn't entirely diffrent issue.

They do things a little bit differently here compared to most places. As soon as we walked in the cashier introduced himself shook my hand, looked me in the eye, and asked for my wife and I's name. He welcomed us then took our order. We ordered a large Sicilian pizza and some garlic knots. Tony said first time customers ALWAYS get something free so he gave us the garlic knots on the house! When we got our pizza we were a little disappointed just because it was the wrong type of pizza. I asked if this was the right one and it seems like there was a mix up on the order (not surprised, they were super busy on a friday night) Tony came out and immediately apologized asked if we wanted to change it out. Since i hate being that customer, I told him now worries. Despite that Tony said he wanted us to still try it and was going to give us some slices for FREE. And I am so glad he did the sicilian pizza was amazing! Super fluffy, cheesy, saucy goodness. And the slices were huge! Tony knows the value of customers and how to treat them right. I told tony we will be coming back (especially for the Sicilian) Key takeaways: Owner or Manager Tony is the man! He knows business and how to satisfy a customer.
