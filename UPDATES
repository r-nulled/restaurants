AFTER READING UP ON THINGS, I'VE DETERMINED THAT FLASK IS MUCH EASIER TO USE THAN DJANGO FOR OUR PURPOSES.
I'VE ALREADY CREATED AN API THROUGH WHICH WE CAN ACCESS THE JSON FILES WE NEED, AS WELL AS RUN THE SCRIPTS
WE WANT TO RUN. ADDING ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY IS JUST A LITTLE MORE WORK. WE CAN MAKE USE OF THIS API THROUGH
ESTABLISHED HTTP GET AND POST USAGE. 

HERE'S A GUIDE ON HOW TO SET THINGS UP.
1. ENTER A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT. PYTHON3 AUTOMATICALLY SUPPORTS THIS.
    1. MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE FOLDER CONTAINING 'venv'
    2. RUN '. venv/bin/activate' (FOR WINDOWS, RUN 'venv\Scripts\activate')
    3. YOUR TERMINAL SHOULD NOW HAVE (venv) SOMEWHERE
2. INSTALL FLASK IN THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
    1. pip install Flask
    2. RUN 'export FLASK_APP=socoloon.py'
    3. FINALLY, 'flask run'. IF THAT FAILS: 'python -m flask run'.
3. VISIT '127.0.0.1:5000/' TO SEE OUR CURRENT PROGRESS

OUR API IS LOCATED AT '127.0.0.1:5000/api/'. SEE socoloon.py FOR URLS TO USE IN ACCESSING DATA.

NOTE: HOME.HTML IS JUST A RENAMED VERSION OF PROJECT_VISUALIZATION.HTML.
